# Finsights_AI
Finsights AI is an innovative AI-powered system designed to predict stock market movements based on real-time financial news and information. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze the sentiment and tone of news headlines, articles, and reports related to companies or sectors, and uses this insight to forecast whether a stock’s price is likely to move up or down . The system continuously collects financial news from trusted sources and converts textual information into meaningful numerical sentiment scores. Using these scores, the machine learning model identifies trends and correlations between news sentiment and actual stock price movements.
